# Bridging Worlds: Discovering the Language for a Hybrid Role in Digital Transformation
Lately, I’ve been reflecting on how to describe what I actually do. Not in the "what's your job title" sense, but in the deeper way—how do I create value, what kind of professional I’ve become, and how I navigate the increasingly blurred lines between strategy, technology, and organizational change.

In Dutch, we have the term bruggenbouwer—literally, "bridge builder." And that’s how it feels. But I’ve come to realize that even that metaphor doesn’t quite capture the nuance of the role I’ve grown into.

Specialist or Generalist? Both. Neither. Something Else.
I’m at a point in my career where I’m both a specialist and a generalist. I have deep expertise in software engineering and digital transformation—particularly around AI and emerging tech. But that’s only part of the story. I also work across teams, across silos, and across perspectives. I talk with CEOs about AI’s impact on strategic decision-making. And then I turn around and work with engineers or support teams to make that vision real.

I don’t just code or just strategize—I move between the two worlds, helping them stay connected.

So how do you describe a role like that?

## Searching for a Name: Concepts That Helped Me Frame It
In my quest to ground this hybrid identity, I found language and ideas that finally resonated.

1. The Full-Stack Strategist
I love this term. It captures the essence of someone who operates across layers—from the high-level business vision to the low-level implementation details. It borrows from software development (full-stack developer) but applies it to strategic execution.

2. The Pi-Shaped Professional
A pi-shaped (π) person has depth in two or more domains—say, engineering and strategy—and broad skills across others. It reflects the reality of working fluidly across disciplines.

3. The Node of Clarity
This metaphor hit home. I’m often the person who distills complexity, who sees patterns in chaos, and who aligns people from different worlds. Not a bottleneck, but a convergence point—where decisions can be made with understanding.

4. The Barbell Strategy
From Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s work, this concept describes holding two extremes at once: one side stable and grounded (deep expertise), the other exploratory and high-risk (innovation, disruption). That’s exactly the kind of balance I strive for in my work—anchored in real capabilities, while pushing boundaries.

## Where I Actually Operate
While I do consulting work and push digital innovation externally with clients, a large part of my impact is internal. I lead our Generative AI team within Witteveen+Bos, where I help shape how our company adopts, governs, and integrates this transformative technology. That means not just experimenting with tools, but designing future-proof strategies that consider our people, workflows, infrastructure, and positioning in the ecosystem.

Externally, I push on what’s possible—leveraging AI, cloud, and data. Internally, I help translate those experiments into organizational change. I work with functional teams (DevOps, IT, digital support) and guide how we align toward new ways of delivering value.

It’s not just doing AI, it’s reshaping how we work and think. And I sit at the heart of that system—both influencing and integrating it.

## Why Naming Matters
You don’t need to label yourself to do the work. But naming your role helps you ground it. It helps others understand your value. It helps you decide what to say yes to. And it helps you scale your impact.

If you, like me, feel like a hybrid—someone who doesn’t quite fit into the boxes of “architect,” “strategist,” or “engineer”—there is power in owning that fluidity. Not as a limitation, but as a design feature.

We need more people who can connect, align, and shape change across domains. If that’s you: welcome. You’re not alone. You’re a bridge, a translator, a strategist, a builder. And the language is finally catching up to you.
